# Overview

This project was an opporunity for me to expand on my React and JavaScript skills. In this project I utilized TypeScript in an effort to learn it.

In this project, I created a Hangman project that utilized arrays to track guessed letters. It includes functionality to show correctly guessed letters, incorrectly guessed letters, and members of the hangman body when an incorrect letter is guessed.
